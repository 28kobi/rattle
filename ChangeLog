  * Bug fix rf.cmd.
  
  * Improve scoring functionality: The dataset can have NA's for target,
    and these can now get scored by rf on Evaluate tab. Loading a CSV file
    to be scored no longer needs to have the target column included
    (previously it needed to be there and have non-NA values). Thanks to
    Chris Snijders.

  * Remove dependency on car - not actually being used at the moment.
  
  * For random forest, allow sample size text entry as a single integer or
    a list, as per randomForest.
  
  * Use na.omit with cforest, as is done with randomForest.
  
  * For randomForest turn subsampling with replacement off since it is
    more likely to produce biased importance measures, as explained in by
    the cforest papers.
  
  * Fix bug with multiple "contact support" lines in error popups.
  
  * When showing the randomForest importance values, sort on the accuracy
    measure rather than the Gini measure, since the Gini is biased in
    favour of categoric variables with many categories.
  
  * ada boost seed should be 42, like all other seeds.
  
  * Tidy up some ada output.
  
  * Bug fix - save project for rf failing (looking for rf_sampsize_entry).
  
  * Remove text from toolbar by default.
  
  * Change order of Forest/Boost buttons on Model tab.
  
  * Add tooltips for all toolbar buttons.

  * Add rattle.info() to list information for debugging purposes.
  
  * Bump pmml to 1.2.22
  
  * Fixes from wenching.lin@zementis.com: Extension in Header should be
    first element. Coefficients in regression models should not be NA (as
    will be for singularities), but replace with, and so no impact of
    change.
  
  * Ensure Survival defaults are reset appropriately.

rattle (2.5.30) stable; urgency=low

  * On MS/Windows with Japanese, read.csv needs encoding option set with
    file rather than with read.csv (for UTF-8) but seems okay under other
    scenarios.
  
  * On MS/Windows with Japanese (UTF-8) the encoding of the variables
    selected for transforming needs to be UTF-8 for much of the process,
    but "unknown" when using Rtxt and sprintf (when substituting the
    variable names) to ensure resulting message is correctly matched for
    encodings.

rattle (2.5.29) stable; urgency=low

  * Add the translation file.
  
  * Fix an Encoding/sprintf issue for Japanese on MS/Windows.
  
  * Allow crv$NOTEBOOK.MODEL.NAME to be overridden by other packages
    (RStat).
  
  * When dispatch fails be sure to include the Tab label on which it fails.
  
  * Ensure HClust Options are re-enabled on loading a project.

rattle (2.5.28) stable; urgency=low

  * Minor format changes for glm and rf model output.
  
  * Capture additional survival model error and suggest a solution.
  
  * Remove spurious additional plot for Survival Residual plot.
  
  * Update log tab labels to be more generic.
  
  * Update tooltips to be generic and add survival tooltips.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Thu, 22 Apr 2010 06:21:58 +1000

rattle (2.5.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Further translation fixes. In particular, use Encoding(...getText())
    <- "UTF-8" to ensure strings from the GUI ate UTF-8, and not unknown.
  
  * Ensure training dataset rather than sample dataset nomenclature is now
    used.
  
  * Ensure execute button can only be clicked once while it is processing.
  
  * Survival plot buttons need to be made sensitive as appropriate.
  
  * For Japanese on MS/Windows do not use monospace font since this ends
    up vertically cenbtering periods and commas (and all other
    characters). Need a fixed width font that does not do this, but for
    now we put up with variable width font.

  * Revert to using only English for all hidden tab labels.
  
  * Improved identification of current plot number.
  
  * Bug fix multiple vars selected for asnumeric and ascategoric
    transforms.

rattle (2.5.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Cross Tab option to Explore tab to generate cross tabulations of
    each categoric variable by the target variable. (Luke Lake)

  * Bug fix - improve how we obtain the plot number from the title,
    particularly in the context of translations.
  
  * Further translation markup.

  * Clean up the use of dfedit.
  
  * Minor improvement to spacing in Log tab.

rattle (2.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Start using the RGtk2DfEdit for the View and Edit buttons of the Data
    tab, and the Enter/Score option of the Evaluate tab. RGtk2DfEdit
    provides a spreadhseet like interface to the data. Various data
    editing options are available. Also press = to run an arbitrary R
    command on selected data (e.g. select two columns of data and issue
    the plot command).
  
  * Add further markup of text for translations.
  
  * Support specification of the character used for decimal points (to
    suit some European usage).
  
  * Fix bug in exporting XML - replace & with &amp;
  
  * Survival plots - split survival chart plot from residuals plots, and
    plot all residuals.

  * Fix logic behind what is greyed out in the Test tab.

rattle (2.5.24) stable; urgency=low

  * Revamp the help text, and put into the Rtxt translation framework.
  
  * Fix the height of the data name widget (the library option was growing
    the width for some reason).
  
  * For Evaluate, add Full and Enter as dataset options. Enter will pop up
    an editor with the final row from the dataset, allowing you to add
    rows or modify the supplied row. We supply the row so that we have an
    example to work from. Full uses the whole original dataset.

rattle (2.5.23) stable; urgency=low

  * Catch "arules" error in converting data to transactions when baskets
    contain repeated items.

  * When data tab is executed, and so crs$rpart is reset to NULL, always
    remove the Draw/Rules button from the Tree option of the Predictive
    tab.
  
  * Add code to fix translations that are not being loaded when using
    RGtk2 on MS/Windows. All is okay on GNU/Linux, but RGtk2 seems not to
    get the right locale for loaded Glade file. The fix is to traverse the
    GUI and change all labels, on starting up Rattle. RGtk2 authors tried
    to fix but it remains an issue.
  
  * Ensure rpart is reset on resetting rattle.
  
  * Rework handling of tab pages because a Japanese translation on
    MS/Windows is having issues with the following call (nd=notebook)
    nb$getTabLabelText(nb$getNthPage(nb$getCurrentPage())) returning what
    looks like Shift-JIS encoding of the string rather than UTF-8, and
    hence not string matching the expected tab label.
  
  * Fix spelling errors on help menu and ensure help for all topics is
    covered.
  
  * For nnet, use MaxNWts=10000 (default is 1000) to allow larger nets by
    default, and capture the error message when this is exceeded and
    better explain what to do.
  
  * Ensure we don't export an empty dataset when choosing export on the
    data tab.
  
  * Capture arules error message when there are repeated items in one
    basket, and explain this more clearly.
  
  * For rpart use information as the default split rather than Gini - makes
    little if any difference.
  
  * Allow showHelpPlus to have an extra/alternative question that is
    displayed.
  
  * All random seeds should be 42.
  
  * Reset kmeans tab on loading a project.
  
  * Add dozen more weather stations to the weatherAUS dataset.

  * Improve the logic for the display of the Report radio buttons on the
    Evaluate tab.
  
  * Spelling correction to a number of tooltips.

  * Default window height is 650, but not forced so that the window
    nicely fills a netbook screen if maximised.
  
  * Bump R dependency to 2.8.0 in line with update of the CITATION file.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 13 Feb 2010 09:48:00 +1100

rattle (2.5.21) stable; urgency=low

  * Re-enable gettext on MS/Windows, even though RGtk2 2.12.18 has not
    fixed the bindtextdomain problem with glade files and package supplied
    translations.
  
  * Change the tree plot to us "< =>" and ">= <" to clearly identify which
    branch the "=" results go. Could not figure out how to get expression
    to us a "ge" symbol.
  
  * Improve formatting of the PvO plots.
  
  * Use the pairs.panels function from the psych package for the default
    scatterplot on the Explore tab.
  
  * Add INSTALL file.

  * Restore missing weather.csv file.
  
  * Add to Google code: weather.R ChangeLog NEWS ToDo upload_uwe.sh
    upload_cran.sh.

rattle (2.5.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure the right labels (Time/Risk rather than Class/Prob) displayed
    in filechooser when exporting a survival model.
  
  * Model tab renamed as Predictive.
  
  * Ensure boxplots have same "by ..." in the main title.
  
  * Update the weather dataset and include many more weather stations in
    the weatherAUS dataset.
  
  * Rtxt does no translations when running on MS/Windows (for now).
