Description: Rattle provides a Gnome (RGtk2) based interface to
  R functionality for data mining. The aim is to provide
  a simple and intuitive interface that allows a user to quickly 
  load data from a CSV file (or via ODBC), transform and explore the data, 
  and build and evaluate models, and export models as PMML (predictive
  modelling markup language). All of this with knowing little about R. 
  All R commands are logged and available for the user, as a tool to 
  then begin interacting directly with R itself, if so desired. Rattle also 
  exports a number of utility functions and the graphical user interface does 
  not need to be run to deploy these.
