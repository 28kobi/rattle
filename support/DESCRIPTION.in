Description: Rattle provides a Gnome (RGtk2) based interface to
  R funtionality for data mining. The aim is to provide
  a simple and intuitive interface that allows a user to quickly 
  load data from a CSV file, explore the data, build some models, and 
  evaluate those models, knowing little about R. All R commands are logged
  and available for the user, as a tool to then begin interacting
  directly with R itself, if so desired. Rattle also exports a number of
  utility functions and the graphical user interface does not need to be
  run to deploy.
