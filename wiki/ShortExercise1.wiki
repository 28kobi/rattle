#summary The 1st short exercise for Rattle.

= The Problem =

Later on in the exercises we shall be exploring how Weather patterns can be examined from the past to help us look at what might happen in the future, for a specific time and location.

So lest start off by examining the weather dataset. 

= The Code =

_Lets Start R_

*Library(rattle)*  _Loads the Rattle package and the associated datasets into the memory._ 

The dataset we need to solve this problem is one associated dataset with Rattle, called weatherAUS.

_Lets load in the dataset_

*weatherAUS*

This first thing we want to do is to get a feel for our data. So we want to look at the names of the variables, 

*names(weatherAUS)* _Shows the variables Names_

[1] "Date"          "Location"      "MinTemp"       "MaxTemp"      
[5] "Rainfall"      "Evaporation"   "Sunshine"      "WindGustDir"  
[9] "WindGustSpeed" "WindDir9am"    "WindDir3pm"    "WindSpeed9am" 
[13] "WindSpeed3pm"  "Humidity9am"   "Humidity3pm"   "Pressure9am"  
[17] "Pressure3pm"   "Cloud9am"      "Cloud3pm"      "Temp9am"      
[21] "Temp3pm"       "RainToday"     "RISK_MM"       "RainTomorrow"

We also want to look at the number of variables and the number of observations.
