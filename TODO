Version 2.1

  Explore Tab Distribution:
    Continuous  -> Histograms with target classes shown

Version 2.2

  General: 
    Export functionality

  Data Tab:
    Access SQLite database

  Evaluate Tab: 
    Implement distribution comparison
    Generate plots to compare distributions
    Model Type = "All" for all built models or use check boxes?

  Model tab
    Use tune to build the best model: rpart, randomForest, svm

TODO

  General:
    Export each model to PMML, SQL, and standalone R script.
    Add a parameter to rattle to load the csv file.
    Add a button to run an R script? (Tony Nolan)
    Add R commands to status line as they are run (Tony Nolan)
    Use rgl for sophisticated graphics?

  Data:
    Drop down data type for each variable perform transform (Robert Williams)

  Cluster:
    Multiple kmeans and plot to find best k (Enrico)

  Models:
    Neural Networks using netalg
    Bayesian using bayesm

========================================================================

MAJOR

Export button
	For Explore tab's Distribution option, export bunch of plots.
	Export of Model should generate PMML of the model.
	Export of Explore->Plot should generate PDF or PNGs of the plots.




Can hier cluster rescale images (Linda)

========================================================================

POSSIBLE

Data tab's ODBC option
	Allow username and password to be specified
	Allow a filename (abc.mdb or efg.xls) and use appropriate calls
		crs$odbc <- odbcConnectExcel("h:/sample.xls")
		crs$odbc <- odbcConnectAccess("h:/sample.mdb")

Memory
	Have a look at biglm for lm on blocks of data - can do 23 million rows

========================================================================

NO LONGER UNDER CONSIDERATION

RODBC
	How best to use RODBC (to MySQL) to properly manage data?
	How would all this be different if all data was stored in MySQL or DWH?
	Or do we handle memory better ourselves by splitting files somewhow?

UNSORTED


##   On load in library, startup the GUI unless some option is set.
##   Rewrite based on example code from Rcmdr as in QCUGUI
##   Identify where Warnings occur and use suppressWarnings(code...)
##   Replace Distributions Button with Radio - make it first/default
##     When execute, for each categorical, if num levels differ, report in TV
##   "New" button to set CRS to zero and clear all textviews and options.

##   Boxplot fails if not numeric data.
##   Graphs to compare distributions of the same variables between datasets 
##   Release on CTAN and write article for Newsletter
##
##   prcomp: NAs in data cause failure - temp soln is use na.omit(ds) and warn.
##   Choice of Kernel for SVMs. 
##   For each textview, add initial text to explain the point (c.f. prcomp)
##
##   Variables: Impute NA as 0, Mean, or KNN (Michael)
##   Mosaic plots (Rohan)
##   2-way tables work (heatmap over cells chi-square significant) (Rohan)
##   Add t/z test and chi2 test in explore tab (Tony)
##   Some solution to the blotches in the hierarchical clusters (Linda)
##   Graphs compare distr between datasets (Rohan and Ray) 
##   Automatically add in an optimal line to risk plot?
##   Add a Cancel/Stop button (Michael)
##   Kernel optimisation ala KXEN.
##   Model visualisation for SVMs 
##   Better report generation for direct inclusion in reports! 
##   3D visualisation of SVM in R (Tony)
##   Outputs - generate a report in Word (Tony)
##   For each library command, check it is available, as with rpart.
##   Need some checks to ensure the weight ends up numeric.
##   Add a threshold value (e.g. 0.2) for use in the Evaluation charts (Ed Cox)
##   For HierCor (and others) convert factors to integers (Tony)
##   Allow Variable types to be changed e.g., factor to integer? (Tony)
##   Save file with ID, Decision (use threshold), Probability (Ed Cox, Fuchun)
##   Evaluate: Add OOB evaluations (Eugene)
##   MODEL RF: Should sampsize be a proportion
##   Seriation plot: add a mouse hover to provide extra info (Tony)
##   Seriation plot: Click to plot all below the click (Tony)
##   Seriation plot: cf Tony's terrain plot and explain
##   Hierachical clustering to highlight targets (hot spots).
##   Get AUC as a measure for ROC curves.
##   Add seriation/colour denrogram www.lirmm.fr/~caraux/PermutMatrix/ (Stuart)
##   Variables: For ratios SAS/EM quantile transform is good - Rohan
##   Add a new Score tab to score a new dataset and save the results. (Fuchun)
##   Explain lift better in the lift tooltip.
##   For multiple targets, choose a different logistic regression method.
##   Print any text view via a Print button.
##   Add MARS (mda package).
##   CLUSTER KMEANS: If a target exists, generate a hot spots display.
##   CLUSTER HIERCOR: Set text size based on # of branches?
##   MISC: set.statusbar clearing is not immediate?
##   EVALUATE: Give error if Variables changed but model not regenerated.
##   MISC: When changing tabs, warn if modified but not executed.
##   BUG: Sample 10% not noticed until ENTER????
##   MISC: Run quit.rattle() when root window destroyed.
##   DATA: Get header, rows, sep, and na.strings working
##   VARIABLES: Bin and Log Transform
##   MODEL RPART: Use print.rules.cmd string for log and eval
##   MODEL: GBM: Implement and document new options
##   EVALUATE RISK: If VARIABLE empty, then just do no Risk curve.
##   EVALUATE: Error when test set has factor levels different to train
##   EVALUATE: Use the text areas to describe the charts.
##   EVALUATE: When Sampling, be sure to apply to only the sample.
##   EVALUATE: Add grids to all plots
##   SAVE: save project (the crs variable) to a Rdata file name.rattle.
##   INIT: Make filename the first active widget. TAB then to Execute.
##   MODEL: Multiple models then optimise with best?
##   VARIABLES: Implement binning to bin wine$Type
##   Help -> Search ... brings up a text entry box
##   Help -> Function ... brings up a text entry box
##   DATA: In the file chooser replace Open with Select?
##   Seriation plot: set point size to tiny (at least can save as PDF to zoom).
##   VARIABLES: Could colour the text in Variable column according to role.
##   VARIABLES: Standardise (convert to -1 to 1) a variable (Ed Cox)
##   VARIABLES: Normalise (subtract mean and divide by the stddev) (Ed Cox)
##   MODEL note when sample has changed, model not updated and we eveluate
##	SAMPLE: Use sample.split of caTools to partition test/train on
##	target to maintain outcome ratio (and thus more likely to
##	ensure there are samples from each class, unlike any old
##	sample).  This does not get around the problem with sampling
##	not including all possible levels for the input variables so it
##	won't help where the testset does not have all possible
##	levels. RandomForest will still complain on the predict.
