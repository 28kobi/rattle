    Rattle: To-Do List
  </p>

  <p>This is a brief list of some of the things in the pipeline or
    suggested by users. Feel free to email me with suggestions and
    priorities and especially code.</p>

<pre>

080427 On Score be sure to include the commands in log.

080419 Accumlate the transforms and apply to new CSV score file (Tom Neice)
080418 Change plots to be tabbed plots with second tab being parameters that
       lay behind the model whose performance is being plotted.
080418 Load rattle script files (.ras) for data, score, test:
080418 Allow txt score file (perhaps automatic if training data is txt)
080415 Fix about Quit button
080408 Transform Tab, "Filter" textbox for rows to keep

071216 Rename binning to not conflict with sm's binning.

071205 Add in Randy Goebel's association rule visualisation (AI07)
071125 Use relaimpo  to calculate relative importance of variables:
       calc.relimp(Adjusted ~ ., audit[,c(2,7,9:10,13)], 
       type = c("lmg", "last", "first", "betasq", "pratt") )
070422 Disable drag and drop from the file open dialogs (Ray Lindsay).
070406 For the cairo plot window, introduce keyboard shortcuts.
070325 Add a Defaults button to each model builder.
070130 Explore->Distr check buttons train/test/csv (csv from Evaluate tab)
070330 Add selection of clustering: diana, agnus, fanny, etc.
070421 Ensure the Help menu is complete.
061019 Numerous graphics extensions (Geir Nilsen)
070401 Add a File Type combo box to graphics save.
070514 FileChooser to also show file sizes (Tony Nolan)
070324 Implement dendrogram zoom using rgl (see plot3d example)?
070321 For the View textview, keep first row (headers) static as "edit()" does
070321 Implement own Edit textview to edit dataset, instead of ugly "edit()"
060703 Kmeans: If a target exists, generate a hot spots display.
070305 Add a "best k" finder using hclust (Daniele Medri)
060821 Explore->Distributions: Clear = clear all radio buttons
070317 Keep the cwd info local to Rattle rather than globally changing.

070317 Make the Explore:Summary:Find search case insensitive.
070121 Each textview have default explanatory text
061001 Choice of Kernel for SVMs. 
070319 Introduce a progress bar for all activities (Tony Nolan)

    Notes
  </p>

<ol>
 <li> The <i>caret</i> package provides a unifying interface to the
 model builders and cold be used underneath in Rattle. It isn't at
 present - Rattle uses the source packages to ensure we teach the use
 of the underlying model builders. As a data miner moves into R they
 may like to consider the use of the <i>caret</i> package for command
 line usage. The package also provides a tuning facility.</li>
 <li>080118: Considered moving to using the VGAM package for
 regression. Decide not to move now - VGAM is hijacking S4 classes for
 predict and other functions. The author is now aware of this.
 library(VGAM) results in all other models no longer working - no
 "predict" and pmml.lm fails with no coefficients!</li>
