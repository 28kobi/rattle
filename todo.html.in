    Notes
  </p>

<ol>
 <li> The <i>caret</i> package provides a unifying interface to the
 model builders and could be used underneath in Rattle. It isn't at
 present - Rattle uses the source packages to ensure we teach the use
 of the underlying model builders. As a data miner moves into R they
 may like to consider the use of the <i>caret</i> package for command
 line usage. The package also provides a tuning facility.</li>
 <li>080118: Considered moving to using the VGAM package for
 regression. Decide not to move now - VGAM is hijacking S4 classes for
 predict and other functions. The VGAM author is now aware of this.
 library(VGAM) results in all other models no longer working - no
 "predict" and pmml.lm fails with no coefficients!</li>
