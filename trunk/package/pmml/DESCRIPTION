Description: The Predictive Modelling Markup Language (PMML) is a language
  for representing models, in an application independent way. Such models
  can then be loaded into other applications supporting PMML, such as
  Teradata Warehouse Miner and IBM's DB2. 

  The package is very much in the early stages of development, and
  contributions (and bug reports) are welcome and encouraged!

  Currently only the export of rpart classification trees and kmeans
  clusters are implemented.

  This package is part of the Rattle toolkit.
