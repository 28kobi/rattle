rattle (2.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Start using the RGtk2DfEdit for the View and Edit buttons of the Data
    tab, and the Enter/Score option of the Evaluate tab. RGtk2DfEdit
    provides a spreadhseet like interface to the data. Various data
    editing options are available. Also press = to run an arbitrary R
    command on selected data (e.g. select two columns of data and issue
    the plot command).
  
  * Add further markup of text for translations.
  
  * Support specification of the character used for decimal points (to
    suit some European usage).
  
  * Fix bug in exporting XML - replace & with &amp;
  
  * Survival plots - split survival chart plot from residuals plots, and
    plot all residuals.

  * Fix logic behind what is greyed out in the Test tab.

rattle (2.5.24) stable; urgency=low

  * Revamp the help text, and put into the Rtxt translation framework.
  
  * Fix the height of the data name widget (the library option was growing
    the width for some reason).
  
  * For Evaluate, add Full and Enter as dataset options. Enter will pop up
    an editor with the final row from the dataset, allowing you to add
    rows or modify the supplied row. We supply the row so that we have an
    example to work from. Full uses the whole original dataset.

rattle (2.5.23) stable; urgency=low

  * Catch "arules" error in converting data to transactions when baskets
    contain repeated items.

  * When data tab is executed, and so crs$rpart is reset to NULL, always
    remove the Draw/Rules button from the Tree option of the Predictive
    tab.
  
  * Add code to fix translations that are not being loaded when using
    RGtk2 on MS/Windows. All is okay on GNU/Linux, but RGtk2 seems not to
    get the right locale for loaded Glade file. The fix is to traverse the
    GUI and change all labels, on starting up Rattle. RGtk2 authors tried
    to fix but it remains an issue.
  
  * Ensure rpart is reset on resetting rattle.
  
  * Rework handling of tab pages because a Japanese translation on
    MS/Windows is having issues with the following call (nd=notebook)
    nb$getTabLabelText(nb$getNthPage(nb$getCurrentPage())) returning what
    looks like Shift-JIS encoding of the string rather than UTF-8, and
    hence not string matching the expected tab label.
  
  * Fix spelling errors on help menu and ensure help for all topics is
    covered.
  
  * For nnet, use MaxNWts=10000 (default is 1000) to allow larger nets by
    default, and capture the error message when this is exceeded and
    better explain what to do.
  
  * Ensure we don't export an empty dataset when choosing export on the
    data tab.
  
  * Capture arules error message when there are repeated items in one
    basket, and explain this more clearly.
  
  * For rpart use information as the default split rather than Gini - makes
    little if any difference.
  
  * Allow showHelpPlus to have an extra/alternative question that is
    displayed.
  
  * All random seeds should be 42.
  
  * Reset kmeans tab on loading a project.
  
  * Add dozen more weather stations to the weatherAUS dataset.

  * Improve the logic for the display of the Report radio buttons on the
    Evaluate tab.
  
  * Spelling correction to a number of tooltips.

rattle (2.5.22) stable; urgency=low

  * Default window height is 650, but not forced so that the window
    nicely fills a netbook screen if maximised.
  
  * Bump R dependency to 2.8.0 in line with update of the CITATION file.

rattle (2.5.21) stable; urgency=low

  * Re-enable gettext on MS/Windows, even though RGtk2 2.12.18 has not
    fixed the bindtextdomain problem with glade files and package supplied
    translations.
  
  * Change the tree plot to us "< =>" and ">= <" to clearly identify which
    branch the "=" results go. Could not figure out how to get expression
    to us a "ge" symbol.
  
  * Improve formatting of the PvO plots.
  
  * Use the pairs.panels function from the psych package for the default
    scatterplot on the Explore tab.
  
  * Add INSTALL file.

rattle (2.5.20) stable; urgency=low

  * Restore missing weather.csv file.
  
  * Add to Google code: weather.R ChangeLog NEWS ToDo upload_uwe.sh
    upload_cran.sh.

rattle (2.5.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure the right labels (Time/Risk rather than Class/Prob) displayed
    in filechooser when exporting a survival model.
  
  * Model tab renamed as Predictive.
  
  * Ensure boxplots have same "by ..." in the main title.
  
  * Update the weather dataset and include many more weather stations in
    the weatherAUS dataset.
  
  * Rtxt does no translations when running on MS/Windows (for now).
